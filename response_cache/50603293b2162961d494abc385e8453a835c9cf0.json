{"query":"yah, can you tell me about the sun?","response":"Sure! The Sun is a big, bright ball of fire in the sky. It gives us light and warmth, making day and night. Without the Sun, plants can't grow, and we can't live! It's super far from Earth, but so big that we can see it clearly. The Sun is also a star, and it will stay in the sky for a long, long time. But remember, never look directly at the Sunâ€”it can hurt your eyes!","timestamp":1740960502137}
